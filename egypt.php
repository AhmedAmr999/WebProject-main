						        <p class="card-text">Keeping you at a hike of about 800 metres long, the Coloured Canyon is located in the Sinai Peninsula, where the nearest town is Nuweiba. Easily reachable via a 4WD, the canyon offers different shades and hues of colours – hence, its name. The colours of the canyon are a result of the receding tides from the Red Sea back then, where the canyon’s rocky walls were formed by sandstone, limestones and granite. </p>

						        <p class="card-text">Mount Moses, which is also known as Jebel Al Tur or Mount Sinai, is 2,285 metres and is considered a holy site by different religions, as it is where prophet Moses, peace be upon him, received the divine commandments from Allah. Hence, for many, it’s more than just a hike, it’s following in the footsteps of Moses.</p>

						        <h5 class="card-title">The Valley of the Whales, Fayoum</h5>
						        <p class="card-text">A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Valley of the Whales, known as Wadi El-Hitan in Arabic, is one of the easiest hikes due to its flat paths. According to UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre, the valley is a proved location in terms of the evolution of the whale from a land-based animal to an ocean-going mammal. The site comprises fossil remains of the now extinct suborder of whales, Archaeoceti, as well as a fossil museum, which is one of the reasons many visitors flock to the Valley of the Whales, located in the Fayoum Oasis.</p>

						        <h5 class="card-title">Wadi Degla Protectorate, Cairo</h5>
						        <p class="card-text">A hike that whisks you away from the overcrowded city of Cairo, the Wadi Degla Protectorate is a place where you can escape city life without crossing its borders. Located in the Maadi district, the Wadi Degla Protectorate extends about 30 kilometres in length. Both its length and flat surface makes it one of the easiest – yet very enjoyable – hikes in Egypt. The valley contains limestone rocks that are about 50 metres in height as well as canyons formed by the rainwater.</p>

						        <h5 class="card-title">Blue Lagoon, Dahab</h5>
						        <p class="card-text">Ranked as a top diving destination for its colourful coral reefs and unique fish, Dahab also has one of the most rewarding hiking trails in Egypt. Considered a coastal hike, it will take you through the crystal blue waters and Sinai’s mountains, where you’ll be greeted by Bedouins every step of the way. Start your hike at the Blue Hole, a worldwide diving spot, stop for a while at Ras Abu Gallum Protectorate, where you can enjoy an authentic lunch and continue your path as you head towards your final stop, the Blue Lagoon, one of the best kitesurfing spots in Egypt.</p>
