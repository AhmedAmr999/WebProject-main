						        <h5 class="card-title">Half Dome, End Of Yosemite Valley In Yosemite National Park California</h5>
						        <p class="card-text"> It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape. One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half.The granite crest rises more than 4,737 ft (1,444 m) above the valley floor.The impression from the valley floor that this is a round dome that has lost its northwest half, is just an illusion. From Washburn Point, Half Dome can be seen as a thin ridge of rock, an arête, that is oriented northeast-southwest, with its southeast side almost as steep as its northwest side except for the very top.</p>
